		<h1>Hello from Codeup!</h1>

			<p>
				My name is Chris Harman and I recently moved to SA from CLE. Honestly, as I grow older, I'm less and less a fan of the <strong>cold</strong> so this move has me smiling a little more knowing that winter <em>is/should</em> be a heck of a lot better here than in CLE.<br> A little more about me; I <strong>love</strong> my kids, photograpny, <em>craft beer</em>, coffee, being outdoors and my dog. I'm sure there are a few other things I could say but, I'm guessing I'll have a chance to add to this as we move on.

				I am a bit of a photographer and love getting shots. This is one I was able to grab at the end of the summer of my kids (yes there are 4 of them! - don't judge)

				As there are many places I have yet to go, naming a favorite vacation spot is tough. I am a huge fan of warmer ocean weather (Southern California style) and a destination I am anxios to hit is Costa Rica. I think I could spend some serious time there. With any luck, at the end of this program, I'll be able to make that happen. I am also a big fan of the mountains. The best place I've been to for that so far has been Colorado. That is some scenary I could definitely get used to.

				<span>While</span> I enjoy a good movie here and there, I don't know that I can say that I have a favorite actor. I was a fan of Leonardo's in Blood Diamond.<br> That probably still ranks up there as one of my favorite movies.
